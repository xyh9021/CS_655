# Assignment Overview
The project utilizes the Strategy Pattern and Factory Pattern to implement an automated vending machine system that can automatically prepare various beverages based on customer selection, including coffee and tea.
The project design follows object-oriented design principles, providing high flexibility and extensibility. It allows for the addition of new product types, such as cakes, as well as new beverage types without needing to modify the existing code.

# Implementation Description 


For each assignment, please answer the following:

Q: Explain the level of flexibility in your implementation, including how new object types can
be easily added or removed in the future.

A:
- Use of Interfaces and Inheritance:
The CookAbility interface and Beverage superclass provide a flexible foundation for adding new object types. 
Any new beverage or food item can easily be added by extending the Beverage class or implementing the CookAbility and Food interfaces. 
This allows you to add new object types without modifying existing code, following the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) of SOLID design principles.
- Use Factory Method Pattern and Strategy pattern:
If I want to add other products such as cakes. I only need to code the cakeCooker
  and set cooker to cakeCooker.
  If I want to add a new beverage later, I only need to code the class of the new beverage and add information to the properties.

Q: Discuss the simplicity and understandability of your implementation, ensuring that it is
easy for others to read and maintain.

A:
- Use of Javadoc Comments:
I've added Javadoc comments to my classes, methods, and fields, which makes it easy for others to understand the functionality and purpose of my code.
This documentation enhances the readability and maintainability of your codebase.
- Consistent Structure:
The consistent structure across similar classes (Americano, Espresso, LatteMacchiato, BlackTea) ensures that any developer familiar with one part of the code can easily understand other similar parts.
This consistency minimizes the learning curve when new developers are introduced to the project.

Q: Describe how you have avoided duplicated code and why it is important.

A:
- Inheritance:
By using inheritance (Beverage as a superclass), Iâ€™ve avoided the need to write the same method implementations across multiple classes. 
For example, the common methods getDescription are defined once in Beverage and inherited by subclasses, reducing redundancy.
- Centralized Utility Methods:
Common functionalities such as reading integer inputs (getInt) and loading properties files (getFoodMap, getFoodToCookerMap) are centralized in the HelperFunction class,
preventing the need to duplicate this logic across multiple classes.

Q: If applicable, mention any design patterns you have used and explain why they were
chosen.

A:
- Factory Method Pattern: Each beverage is made with a beverageCooker. If I want to add other products such as cakes. I only need to code the cakeCooker
and set cooker to cakeCooker.
- Strategy pattern: Create objects dynamically via reflection. It can reduce if-else statements. 
And If I want to add a new beverage later, I only need to code the class of the new beverage and add information to the properties.



# Maven Commands

We'll use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. You'll need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) on your system. 

Apache Maven is a build automation tool and a project management tool for Java-based projects. Maven provides a standardized way to build, package, and deploy Java applications.

Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file to manage the build process and its dependencies. The POM file contains information about the project, such as its dependencies, the build configuration, and the plugins used for building and packaging the project.

Maven provides a centralized repository for storing and accessing dependencies, which makes it easier to manage the dependencies of a project. It also provides a standardized way to build and deploy projects, which helps to ensure that builds are consistent and repeatable.

Maven also integrates with other development tools, such as IDEs and continuous integration systems, making it easier to use as part of a development workflow.

Maven provides a large number of plugins for various tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, generating reports, and creating JAR files. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used for many different types of Java projects.

## Compile
Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```



## JUnit Tests
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java. JUnit tests are automated tests that are written to verify that the behavior of a piece of code is as expected.

In JUnit, tests are written as methods within a test class. Each test method tests a specific aspect of the code and is annotated with the @Test annotation. JUnit provides a range of assertions that can be used to verify the behavior of the code being tested.

JUnit tests are executed automatically and the results of the tests are reported. This allows developers to quickly and easily check if their code is working as expected, and make any necessary changes to fix any issues that are found.

The use of JUnit tests is an important part of Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the code they are testing is written. This helps to ensure that the code is written in a way that is easily testable and that all required functionality is covered by tests.

JUnit tests can be run as part of a continuous integration pipeline, where tests are automatically run every time changes are made to the code. This helps to catch any issues as soon as they are introduced, reducing the need for manual testing and making it easier to ensure that the code is always in a releasable state.

To run, use the following command:
```bash
mvn clean test
```


## Spotbugs 

SpotBugs is a static code analysis tool for Java that detects potential bugs in your code. It is an open-source tool that can be used as a standalone application or integrated into development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Gradle.

SpotBugs performs an analysis of the bytecode generated from your Java source code and reports on any potential problems or issues that it finds. This includes things like null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, misused collections, and other common bugs.

The tool uses data flow analysis to examine the behavior of the code and detect issues that might not be immediately obvious from just reading the source code. SpotBugs is able to identify a wide range of issues and can be customized to meet the needs of your specific project.

Using SpotBugs can help to improve the quality and reliability of your code by catching potential bugs early in the development process. This can save time and effort in the long run by reducing the need for debugging and fixing issues later in the development cycle. SpotBugs can also help to ensure that your code is secure by identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

Use the following command:

```bash
mvn spotbugs:gui 
```

SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


## Checkstyle 

Checkstyle is a development tool for checking Java source code against a set of coding standards. It is an open-source tool that can be integrated into various integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse and IntelliJ, as well as build tools like Maven and Gradle.

Checkstyle performs static code analysis, which means it examines the source code without executing it, and reports on any issues or violations of the coding standards defined in its configuration. This includes issues like code style, code indentation, naming conventions, code structure, and many others.

By using Checkstyle, developers can ensure that their code adheres to a consistent style and follows best practices, making it easier for other developers to read and maintain. It can also help to identify potential issues before the code is actually run, reducing the risk of runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Checkstyle is highly configurable and can be customized to fit the needs of your team or organization. It supports a wide range of coding standards and can be integrated with other tools, such as code coverage and automated testing tools, to create a comprehensive and automated software development process.

The following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open in a web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```
